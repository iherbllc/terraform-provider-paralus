  A provider to allow for the management of paralus resources through the [paralus CTL library](https://github.com/paralus/cli)
---

# {{ .ProviderShortName | upper }} Provider

The "paralus" provider allows for the manipulation of components in the [Paralus](https://paralus.io) interface.
This is to allow for the dynamic management of clusters and projects within the UI. Access is granted through a token
generated by the UI. See [CLI](https://www.paralus.io/docs/usage/cli). This information can either be
provided in a config json file that TF can access (the path of which is defined either by the pctl_config_json provider variable
 or PCTL_CONFIG_JSON env var), as individual provider variables, or various env variables.

NOTE: While environment variables can be used in conjunction with either the config json or provider input variables,
the config json validation will act independently of the individual provider ones. Therefore either ENV + CONFIG_JSON must provide
all relevent values or ENV + PROVIDER_VARs. Otherewise, the provider will fail.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

### Manually Supplied Values

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

### Config JSON Supplied

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider_config_json.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Important Notes

This provider relies on the [Paralus cli](https://github.com/paralus/cli) tool for buiding out the configuration and various structs.
The actual calls to paralus are through fasthttp to the [Paralus API](https://github.com/paralus/paralus).

See [Paralus API Swagger](https://paralus.github.io/paralus/) for a list of the various APIs. The calls to the APIs rely on the
`X-API-KEYID` and `X-API-TOKEN` headers sent to the API and handled by the CLI. These values are marked as secret and will not be
returned in the provider call

If you keep getting 404 errors when attempting to make a call to the provider, try removing the port from the OPS_ENDPOINT and REST_ENDPOINT values or config json entries.
