# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

{{.Description}}

NOTE: Due to a limitation with paralus, there cannot be more than one project_role block with the same role type. 
Use the [Group Resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/iherbllc/paralus/latest/docs/resources/group) after
creating the project to grant the same role. 

See the paralus issue [136](https://github.com/paralus/paralus/issues/136) for more information.

## Example Usage

### Role - Single

{{ tffile "examples/resources/paralus_project/resource.tf" }}

### Role - Multiple

{{ tffile "examples/resources/paralus_project/resource_multiple.tf" }}

### Users

{{ tffile "examples/resources/paralus_project/resource_users.tf" }}
