# PARALUS Provider

The "paralus" provider allows for the manipulation of components in the [Paralus](https://paralus.io) interface. 
This is to allow for the dynamic management of clusters and projects within the UI. Access is granted through a token
generated by the UI. See [CLI](https://www.paralus.io/docs/usage/cli). This information can either be
provided in a config json file that TF can access or as individual provider entries.

NOTE: Partner and Organization are required for project management, either as provider entries, config entries, or env vars

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
## Provider string 

provider "paralus" {
    version = "1.0"
    pctl_profile = "test"
    pctl_rest_endpoint = "https://paralus.example.com:443"
    pctl_ops_endpoint = "https://paralus.example.com:443"
    pctl_api_key = "1111111"
    pctl_api_secret = "222222222"
    pctl_partner = "Howdy"
    pctl_organization = "Doodey"
}
```

## Important Notes

This provider relies on the [Paralus cli|https://github.com/paralus/cli] tool.
All calls made to Paralus are through the tool, which in turn calls the [Paralus API](https://github.com/paralus/paralus).

See [Paralus API Swagger](https://paralus.github.io/paralus/) for a list of the various APIs. The actual calls to the APIs rely on the
`X-API-KEYID` and `X-API-TOKEN` headers sent to the API and handled by the CLI. These values are marked as secret and will not be
returned in the provider call
